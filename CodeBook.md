## Course Project Code Book


* I chose only the mean and std functions from the features_info.txt. The variables of interst are 33 each for mean and std making it 66

* The names are of the following form in the output file:

        "timeDomainValuesOfBodyAccelerationMeanAlongXAxis"
        "timeDomainValuesOfBodyAccelerationMeanAlongYAxis"
        "timeDomainValuesOfBodyAccelerationMeanAlongZAxis"
        "timeDomainValuesOfBodyAccelerationStandardDeviationAlongXAxis"
        "timeDomainValuesOfBodyAccelerationStandardDeviationAlongYAxis"
        "timeDomainValuesOfBodyAccelerationStandardDeviationAlongZAxis" 
        "timeDomainValuesOfGravityAccelerationMeanAlongXAxis"
etc.

* Note that the activity labels the descriptive variable names were added and the total variable of our data are now 68

* We have 30 subjects and 6 activities, therefore, we get 180 observations of means for each subject and activity in the output file
